I think one of the ways is to reduce the things I'll focus on in every period.

And I feel that the true intention of this question is to let us ask ourselves whether we're sure we're going to heaven, i.e., where will we be 100 years from now? It wouldn't matter what we've achieved here on earth if we'll suffer for all eternity.",
